                        The Sligo Bikes website was set up in March of 2021 by Emmet Carroll while studying in Sligo IT. The goal is to bring cycling spots in Sligo County to the locals and whole of Ireland. Emmet grew up mountainbiking and moved onto downhill mountainbiking in 2012. He also took up BMX in the same year. He's always on the lookout for new  cycling routes, coillte approved forests or skateparks. From the homepage, simply choose your discipline from the list and all the information and resources that youll need to ride happily and safely will be shown. Below, you will find descriptions of each discipline just so you know where you fit in to the diverse world of cycling.

                        Mountain biking is a sport of riding bicycles off-road, often over rough terrain, usually using specially designed mountain bikes. Mountain bikes share similarities with other bikes but incorporate features designed to enhance durability and performance in rough terrain, such as air or coil-sprung shocks used as suspension, larger and wider wheels and tyres, stronger frame materials, and mechanically or hydraulically actuated disc brakes. Mountain biking can generally be broken down into five distinct categories: cross country, trail riding, all mountain (also referred to as "Enduro"), downhill, and freeride.[1]This sport requires endurance, core strength and balance, bike handling skills, and self-reliance. Advanced riders pursue both steep technical descents and high incline climbs. In the case of freeride, downhill, and dirt jumping, aerial maneuvers are performed off both natural features and specially constructed jumps and ramps.[2]Mountain bikers ride on off-road trails such as singletrack, back-country roads, wider bike park trails, fire roads, and some advanced trails are designed with jumps, berms, and drop-offs to add excitement to the trail. Riders with enduro and downhill bikes will often visit ski resorts that stay open in the summer to ride downhill-specific trails, using the ski lifts to return to the top with their bikes. Because riders are often far from civilization, there is a strong element of self-reliance in the sport. Riders learn to repair broken bikes and flat tires to avoid being stranded. Many riders carry a backpack, including water, food, tools for trailside repairs, and a first aid kit in case of injury. Group rides are common, especially on longer treks. Mountain bike orienteering adds the skill of map navigation to mountain biking.<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mountain_biking">more text...</a>

                       Road cycling is an activity most commonly performed on a bicycle. Road cycling in its modern form was invented in Germany on Aug 12, 1817. There are many types of bicycles that are used on the roads including: BMX, recumbents, racing, touring and utility bicycles.Dedicated road bicycles have drop handlebars and multiple gears, although there are single and fixed gear varieties. Road bikes also use narrow, high-pressure tires to decrease rolling resistance, and tend to be somewhat lighter than other types of bicycle. The drop handlebars are often positioned lower than the saddle in order to put the rider in a more aerodynamic position. In an effort to become more aerodynamic, some riders have begun using aerobars.[1] Who and when aerobars where invented is unclear but they seem to date back to the early 1980s.[2] The light weight and aerodynamics of a road bike allows this type of bicycle to be the second most efficient self-powered means of transportation, behind only recumbent bicycles due to the latter's higher aerodynamic efficiency.Mountain bikes fitted with slick or semi-slick are also popular for commuters. Though less efficient, the upright riding position allows the cyclist a better view of traffic, and they can also be readily fitted with mudguards, cargo racks and other accessories. Mountain bikes are usually ridden on unpaved roads and tracks but they are not to be confused with cyclocross bikes. A hybrid form of road cycling has been gaining solid ground lately called cyclo-cross. Cyclo-cross (sometimes CCX, CX, cyclocross) is bicycling off-road and not to be confused with mountain biking. Cyclo-cross bikes are nearly identical to traditional road bikes but tend to have a longer wheelbase, a higher bottom-bracket for improved clearance over obstacles and tread on their tires for the purpose of riding on unpaved roads and rough trails.<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Road_cycling">more text...</a>

                      The word BMX is an acronym for Bicycle Moto Cross. The term was originated in the 1970’s when kids started racing their bikes on dirt tracks in southern California. The origination was focused on the racing side of things with an emphasis on the jumping, speed and style. It wasn’t long until tricks started making their way into this new sport and a whole new genre of BMX was formed. BMX racing and Freestyle BMX.As we mentioned above, BMX stands for Bicycle Moto Cross. The term originally coined by those kids racing their bikes on dirt tracks imitating dirt bikes or motocross racers. However, the meaning has expanded quite a bit over the years and could mean a number of things. When a BMX rider tells somebody that they “ride BMX”, it could mean anything from BMX racing to BMX freestyle where they might ride street, parks, dirt jumps or flatland. They might even get into a little bit of everything. Typically we find racing and freestyle separated since they are quite literally different worlds. For instance, BMX Union focuses on the freestyle aspect because the racing side is a whole thing on its own with many different brands (some brands do make both racing and freestyle products such as Profile Racing and S&M Bikes for an example), sponsored riders, events and more that only cater to racing, much like freestyle has events that only cater to freestyle. We grew up on freestyle and have only raced a few times for fun, so we leave it to the racing experts to cover that side of the sport.<a href="https://bmxunion.com/what-is-bmx-what-does-it-mean/">more text...</a>
