                    <p>
                      There are different styles of mountainbiking. Cross Country, Enduro and Downhill will all require different safety gear to ride safely. Here is what you should buy before:
                        Cross Country: Being the least extreme of the three, its no surprise that you can pack fairly light with the safety gear. All thats really suggeseted is a good open faced helmet. Gloves and proper mountain biking shoes are reccomended, along with a jersey and pair of lightweight shorts. !!!!instert images
